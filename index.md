Hi there! I am a PhD student at [Complexity Science Hub](https://csh.ac.at) in Vienna and the [Department of Network and Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) (DNDS) of [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/). Computer Science graduate of [RWTH Aachen University](https://rwth-aachen.de) and [FH Aachen University](https://fh-aachen.de).

In my research I study how inequalities between a minority and majority group can emerge from local collaboration behavior.
My projects center around Gender Inequalities in temporally evolving collaboration networks and associated rank dynamics.
All of these projects are made possible with awesome collaborators from the [Network Inequality Group](https://networkinequality.com/) lead by [Fariba Karimi](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/fariba-karimi/) ✌️

Beyond my research interests, I am very passionate about bouldering, hiking, books and movies.
Feel free to drop me a message in case you want to discuss any of my research, or anything else really.
